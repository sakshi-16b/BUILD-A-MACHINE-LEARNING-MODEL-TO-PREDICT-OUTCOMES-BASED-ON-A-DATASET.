#DESCRIPTION

*It reads the data in manageable chunks (16MB blocks), so you're not limited by RAM.
*A local Dask cluster is set up, with workers processing these chunks in parallel, speeding up computations. You can even watch it work via a dashboard link!
*We demonstrate complex aggregations, like finding the average quantity sold per product by region and month, all handled efficiently by Dask.
*Finally, a bar chart visualizes these insights, making trends clear.
